# docker-familiar
My systematised knowledge about docker.


## Dictrionary

__Image__ - everything needed to run container - the code/binary, runtimes, dependencies and other objects required.
__Container__ - running process isolated from host and other containers. Every container has its own filesystem.

## Image
`docker image ls` list all images


## Container
`docker container ls` / `docker ps` list all containers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`--all` show all containers as default shows only running containers
